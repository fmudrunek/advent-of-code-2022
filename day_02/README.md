## Input
A strategy guide for Rock-Paper-Scrissors. The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. The second column is    what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. E.g.
```
A Y
B X
C Z
```
Score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won)
